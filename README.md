 Suvidha Foundation Website (Demo)

This is a demo website created for **Suvidha Foundation** as a part of a practice and learning project. The website is built to represent the basic structure of an NGO website with essential pages like Home, About, Gallery, Donate, and Donors.

This project is a demo version and not a production-grade deployment. Several parts are intentionally simplified to reduce development time.


##  Features

- 🏠 Home Page with basic navigation and banner
- 🧾 About Us section with organization information
- 🖼️ Gallery Page showcasing images (demo content repeated intentionally)
- 💳 Donation Page with **only Card Payment** method integrated (demo purpose)
- 🙏 Donors Page listing donors (uses repeated names for simplicity)
- 📞 Contact section (static for demo)
- 📱 Responsive design basics

---

##  Limitations (Intentional for Demo)

To focus on key concepts and speed up development:

- 🖼️ **Same images are used** across the gallery and other pages
- 💳 **Only card payment** option is integrated on the donation page
- 🙋 **Same donor name is repeated** on the donors page
- ❌ No backend or database is connected
- 🔐 No authentication or login features



## 🛠 Technologies Used
